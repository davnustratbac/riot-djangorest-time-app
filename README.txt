# task management with django-rest,riot, and django-core

Testing a react-like setup with a component library (riot.js) fed data from a rest endpoint (django-reset). However, still using server to render static pages. 

The Idea is that I like everything that django gives out of the box with session state management, authentication, permissions ect - but also like react-like user interfaces.
